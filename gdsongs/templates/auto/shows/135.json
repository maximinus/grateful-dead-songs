In other words, don\u2019t stand on the seats or kick in the walls or rip out the ornaments seeing how this is the only place we\u2019d like to play around here. And if we can\u2019t come here back to this theatre we won\u2019t come to back to this town, which means you\u2019ll have to go to Kiel auditorium and listen to \u2018Grand Funk Railroad\u2019.
